#### Decision Theory and Ethics

##### Fairness in Decision Making

Decision making under uncertainty involves not only accuracy and utility maximization but also fundamental
considerations of fairness. Probabilistic reasoning systems can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify societal biases when
their outputs impact individuals or groups differentially.

Several formal definitions of fairness have emerged to address these concerns:

**Group Fairness Metrics**:

- **Demographic Parity**: Requires that decisions be independent of protected attributes (e.g., race, gender).
  Mathematically, for decision D and protected attribute A: P(D=1|A=a) = P(D=1|A=b) for all values a, b.
- **Equalized Odds**: Requires equal true positive and false positive rates across protected groups. For decision D,
  outcome Y, and protected attribute A: P(D=1|Y=y,A=a) = P(D=1|Y=y,A=b) for all y, a, b.
- **Predictive Parity**: Requires equal positive predictive values across groups. P(Y=1|D=1,A=a) = P(Y=1|D=1,A=b).

**Individual Fairness Concepts**:

- **Similar Treatment**: Similar individuals should receive similar decisions.
- **Counterfactual Fairness**: A decision is fair if it would be the same in a counterfactual world where the
  individual's protected attributes were different.
- **Fairness Through Awareness**: Explicitly accounts for protected attributes to ensure fair outcomes.

The implementation of fairness in probabilistic systems introduces several technical challenges:

1. **Impossibility Theorems**: Multiple fairness criteria cannot be simultaneously satisfied except in degenerate cases.
2. **Fairness-Accuracy Trade-offs**: Enforcing fairness constraints often reduces predictive accuracy.
3. **Long-term Impact**: Short-term fairness measures may have unexpected long-term consequences.
4. **Data Biases**: Historical data often contains societal biases that models might learn and perpetuate.

Approaches to implementing fairness in probabilistic decision systems include:

- **Pre-processing**: Transforming training data to remove biases before model training.
- **In-processing**: Modifying learning algorithms to incorporate fairness constraints.
- **Post-processing**: Adjusting model outputs to satisfy fairness criteria.
- **Causal Modeling**: Using causal inference to identify and mitigate sources of unfairness.

```

Real-world applications require careful consideration of the specific fairness criteria relevant to the domain. For
example, in criminal justice, equalizing false positive rates across groups may be critical, while in lending, ensuring
similar approval rates for qualified applicants across groups might be prioritized.

The field continues to evolve as researchers develop more nuanced fairness definitions and techniques to balance
competing ethical considerations within the framework of probabilistic decision making.

##### Handling Value Uncertainty

Value uncertainty refers to uncertainty about the appropriate utility function to apply when making decisions. Unlike
traditional uncertainty about states of the world, value uncertainty concerns our incomplete knowledge about what
outcomes should be preferred.

**Sources of Value Uncertainty**:

1. **Preference Elicitation Challenges**:
    - Inconsistent human preferences
    - Context-dependence of utilities
    - Difficulty articulating complex values
    - Strategic misrepresentation of preferences
2. **Moral Uncertainty**:
    - Uncertainty about which ethical framework to apply
    - Competing moral principles with different implications
    - Weighing consequentialist vs. deontological considerations
    - Cultural and contextual variation in values
3. **Multiple Stakeholders**:
    - Different stakeholders with conflicting values
    - Aggregation challenges for group utilities
    - Power imbalances in preference representation
    - Intertemporal considerations between present and future stakeholders

**Approaches to Handling Value Uncertainty**:

1. **Robust Decision Making**:
    - Maximin approach: Maximize the minimum utility across possible value functions
    - Minimax regret: Minimize the maximum regret relative to optimal decisions
    - Satisficing: Find decisions that meet minimal thresholds across all value functions
    - Robust optimization with bounded value uncertainty
2. **Meta-Normative Frameworks**:
    - Expected moral value: Probability-weighted average across moral theories
    - Moral hedging: Balancing decisions across different value systems
    - Maximizing expected choice-worthiness across theories
    - Variance normalization for incomparable value scales
3. **Value Learning**:
    - Inverse reinforcement learning from human decisions
    - Active preference elicitation with uncertainty reduction
    - Cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL)
    - Multi-agent value alignment through interaction
4. **Value of Value Information**:
    - Quantifying the decision value of reducing value uncertainty
    - Optimal allocation of resources to preference elicitation
    - Sequential value refinement strategies
    - Interactive preference specification

The challenge of value uncertainty remains one of the most profound issues in decision theory, particularly as AI
systems gain greater autonomy and impact on human welfare. Addressing it requires integration of technical approaches
with philosophical insights about the nature of value, preferences, and ethical principles.

##### Ethical Considerations in Utility Design

The design of utility functions for decision-making systems embeds ethical choices that profoundly influence system
behavior and outcomes. As probabilistic systems increasingly drive consequential decisions, careful utility design
becomes an ethical imperative.

**Foundational Issues in Utility Design**:

1. **Ethical Frameworks and Utility**:
    - Consequentialist approaches: Mapping outcomes to utility values
    - Deontological constraints: Incorporating rights and duties as constraints
    - Virtue ethics: Designing utilities that promote virtuous agent behavior
    - Pluralist approaches: Balancing multiple ethical considerations
2. **Value Commensurability**:
    - The challenge of measuring diverse values on common scales
    - Lexicographic preferences: Some values infinitely outweigh others
    - Rights violations as lexical constraints
    - Bounded utility functions to prevent infinite value trade-offs
3. **Interpersonal Utility Comparisons**:
    - The philosophical challenge of comparing utility across individuals
    - Welfarist approaches: Focus on well-being measures
    - Capability approaches: Focus on expanding human capabilities
    - Distributional concerns: Prioritizing less advantaged individuals

**Practical Design Challenges**:

1. **Proxies and Surrogates**:
    - The inevitable gap between true values and measurable proxies
    - Goodhart's Law: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure
    - Gaming and specification gaming in reinforcement learning
    - Designing robust proxies resistant to manipulation
2. **Temporal Aspects**:
    - Discounting future utilities and intergenerational justice
    - Hyperbolic vs. exponential discounting

#### Non-standard Models of Uncertainty

##### Dempster-Shafer Theory

Dempster-Shafer theory (DST), also known as evidence theory or the theory of belief functions, provides a framework for
reasoning under uncertainty that generalizes probability theory to handle incomplete knowledge and partial evidence.

**Foundational Concepts**:

1. **Basic Probability Assignment (BPA)**:

    - Function m: 2^Θ → [0,1] mapping from the power set of the frame of discernment Θ to [0,1]
    - m(∅) = 0
    - Σ\_{A⊆Θ} m(A) = 1
    - m(A) represents evidence supporting exactly set A, not necessarily its subsets

2. **Belief and Plausibility Functions**:

    - Belief function: Bel(A) = Σ\_{B⊆A} m(B)
        - Lower bound on probability of A
        - Amount of evidence specifically supporting A
    - Plausibility function: Pl(A) = 1 - Bel(Ā) = Σ\_{B∩A≠∅} m(B)
        - Upper bound on probability of A
        - Amount of evidence not contradicting A
    - Uncertainty interval: [Bel(A), Pl(A)]

    1. **Dempster's Rule of Combination**:
        - Combines independent pieces of evidence
        - For two mass functions m₁ and m₂: (m₁ ⊕ m₂)(C) = K⁻¹ Σ\_{A∩B=C} m₁(A)m₂(B)
        - Where K = 1 - Σ\_{A∩B=∅} m₁(A)m₂(B) is a normalization factor
        - Handles conflict between evidence sources

**Theoretical Advantages**:

1. **Representation of Ignorance and Partial Knowledge**:
    - Explicit modeling of ignorance through m(Θ)
    - Distinction between uncertainty and ignorance
    - No forced assignment of probabilities without evidence
    - Representation of non-specific evidence
2. **Generalization of Probability Theory**:
    - Bayesian probability as special case (when all mass on singletons)
    - More expressive belief representation
    - Natural handling of set-valued observations
    - Compatibility with classical probability when evidence warrants
3. **Decision Theory Extensions**:
    - Decisions based on belief-plausibility intervals
    - Non-additive decision criteria
    - Robust decision making with ambiguity
    - Upper/lower expected utility

Dempster-Shafer theory provides a flexible framework for reasoning under uncertainty, particularly valuable in contexts
with incomplete, ambiguous, or conflicting evidence. Its ability to represent partial ignorance and distinguish between
different types of uncertainty offers advantages in applications where forcing precise probabilities would be artificial
or misleading.

##### Possibility Theory

Possibility theory provides an alternative framework for handling uncertainty, focusing on the representation of
imprecise or incomplete information through possibility distributions rather than probability distributions.

**Fundamental Concepts**:

1. **Possibility Distribution**:
    - Function π: Ω → [0,1] mapping from universe of discourse to [0,1]
    - max\_{x∈Ω} π(x) = 1 (normalization)
    - π(x) represents the degree to which x is possible
    - Models epistemic uncertainty (state of knowledge) rather than aleatory uncertainty (random variation)
2. **Possibility and Necessity Measures**:
    - Possibility measure: Π(A) = max\_{x∈A} π(x)
        - Degree to which event A is possible
        - Dual to necessity: Π(A) = 1 - N(Ā)
    - Necessity measure: N(A) = 1 - Π(Ā) = min\_{x∉A} (1 - π(x))
        - Degree to which event A is certain
        - N(A) > 0 implies Π(A) = 1
3. **Comparative Semantics**:
    - Ordinal structure of possibilities
    - Relative possibility more fundamental than numeric values
    - Comparative expressions of uncertainty
    - Qualitative possibility theory as foundation

**Theoretical Properties**:

    - Consistency vs. additivity for managing uncertainty
    - Different handling of ignorance
    - Encoding of preference and uncertainty
3. **Connection to Other Theories**:
    - Consonant belief functions in Dempster-Shafer theory
    - Upper/lower probabilities interpretation
    - Relationship to modal logic
    - Rough set theory connections

Possibility theory offers a distinctive approach to uncertainty that is particularly suited for modeling linguistic
imprecision, incomplete knowledge, and preference structures. Its qualitative nature and computational simplicity make
it attractive for applications where probability theory might require unjustified precision or impose excessive
computational demands.

    - Developing intuitive understanding of uncertainty
    - Interactive exploration of probabilistic concepts
    - Metacognitive support for reasoning
    - Adaptive tutoring based on cognitive models

AI systems designed with awareness of human cognitive patterns can provide more effective support for reasoning under
uncertainty. Rather than assuming idealized rationality or attempting to eliminate human judgment, cognitive-inspired AI
design creates systems that complement human strengths, compensate for limitations, and integrate successfully into
human decision processes.
